Our project team members check your pull requests. Once the pull requests are
approved and pass continuous integration checks, we will apply 'okay_to_pull' label
to your request. This label means your request will submit to our internal repository.
After the change has been submitted successfully, your pull request will be merged on GitHub.

Also you can write issue on this tab if you find some issues.  
If you decide to start an issue, then leave comment so other people know that you are working
on it.  
If you want to help out, but not alone, use the issue
comment thread to coordinate.  
### Contribution guidelines and standards

Before sending your pull request for
[review](https://github.com/ossteam8/oss8_proj/pulls),
make sure your changes are consistent with the guidelines and follow the coding style.


#### General guidelines and philosophy for contribution
*   Please include unit tests when you contribute new features, as they help to a)
    prove that your code works correctly, and b) guard against future breaking
    changes to lower the maintenance cost.
*   Bug fixes also generally require unit tests, because the presence of bugs
    usually indicates insufficient test coverage.
*   Also, write your environments of your computer system include hardware and software.
